This repository contains the data and code used in exploratory data analysis of Chicago food inspections occurring between January 2010 and October 2023.
My primary objectives are to conduct a spatial analysis of food inspection occurrences, identifying areas of high and low occurrences, and determining correlations between inspection frequency and other measures in the data frame. 
Furthermore, I aim to ascertain if more restaurants in an area significantly affect the results of inspections in that area. 
Answering this question will shed light on whether increased competition between restaurants has a favorable or an adverse effect on the cleanliness of establishments. 
This was a project I worked on for Northwestern's MSDS program. 

The original data files for this project can be found on the [City of Chicago website](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5 ).
A cleaned and processed version of this data set can be found in this repository under the file name food_inspection_final.csv.

In addition, I would like to thank [enactdev](https://github.com/OpenDataDE/State-zip-code-GeoJSON/blob/master/il_illinois_zip_codes_geo.min.json) for uploading the il_illinois_zip_codes_geo.min.json geo json file used in mapping the Chicago zip codes.
